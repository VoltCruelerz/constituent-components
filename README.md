# Constituent Components

_This mod requires Greed 1.2.0 or higher._

Most of the components in Sins II are cool, but some leave something to be desired.

## Changes

### Existing Components

- **Antimatter Engine**
    - autocast: now exists (triggers at <40% antimatter)
- **Combat Repair System**: affects the fleet for 1/3 rate (5hps)
- **Derelict Specialists**
    - changed to Tier 1
    - added unique icon
- **Exotics Salvage Policy**
    - installation: 120 => 30 seconds
- **Heavy Gauss Slugs**: affects Rail Guns and improves range by 5000.
- **Radiation Bomb**
    - installation: 90 => 30 seconds
    - cooldown: 180 => 60 seconds
- **Reserve Hangar**: removed restriction on already having a squadron
- **Salvage Kit**
    - installation: 90 => 30 seconds
    - cooldown: 120 => 20 seconds
    - scaling: now scales with combat repair droid research for 10/20/30 HPS
    - targeting: can now apply to repair allied units as well
- **Tactical Analyst**

### New Components

    - _Unbreachable Hull_ research is a prerequisite
    - +2000 hull, +0.4 HPS, +75 armor

### Other Changes

- **Archaeology Center Prototype**: clarified text. Did _you_ know it gives you a cache of resources every 8 min? I sure didn't.
