# Constituent Components

Most of the components in Sins II are cool, but some leave something to be desired.

## Changes

### Existing Components

- [X] **Radiation Bomb**
    - installation: 90 => 30 seconds
    - cooldown: 180 => 60 seconds
- [X] **Reserve Hangar**: removed restriction on already having a squadron
- [X] **Combat Repair System**: affects the fleet for 1/3 rate (5hps)
- [X] **Exotics Salvage Policy**
    - installation: 120 => 30 seconds
- [X] **Antimatter Engine**

- [X] **Salvage Kit**
    - installation: 90 => 30 seconds
    - cooldown: 120 => 20 seconds
- [X] **Tactical Analyst**
    - research: reduced to tier 2 and has _Basic Crew Training_ as a prerequisite
- [X] **Volatile Accelerants**: passively grants +25% linear and angular speed
- [ ] **Heavy Gauss Slugs**: Gauss cannons reduce enemy armor

### New Components

- [X] **Unbreachable Hull** (Kol): same effect as on Argonev

- [ ] **Martial Command**: planet regenerates loyalty while ship is in orbit
- [ ] **Sabotage Crews**: greatly reduces counterdeployment rates
- [ ] **Last Stand**: drastically improves performance, but gives the ship a passive hp loss.
- [ ] **Flak Countermeasures**:
    - [ ] ? missiles fired by nearby friendly units have shields
    - [ ] ? missiles move faster
    - [ ] ? missiles have armor
    - [ ] ? missiles dodge chance

### Other Changes

- [X] **Archaeology Center Prototype**: clarified text. Did _you_ know it gives you a cache of resources every 8 min? I sure didn't.
